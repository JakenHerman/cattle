# cattle - Google Calendar in your Terminal

<img align="right" height="300" src="http://i.imgur.com/QRYe22d.jpg">

---

cattle is an npm package that allows you to access your Google calendar through your terminal. Once the package is complete, you will be able to read events from your calendar in your terminal as well as add new events into it. After these features are complete, we will look to expand the package to include other calendar and to-do applications.

## Install

```sh
$ npm install -g cattle
```

This will not work yet, as the package has not been published - but this is the basic npm install command. Cattle depends on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/). Also make sure that [git](http://git-scm.com/) is installed.
